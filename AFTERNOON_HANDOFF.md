## 🎯 **MORNING ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**

## 📊 **CURRENT PLATFORM STATUS:**

### **✅ WORKING PERFECTLY:**
- **Authentication**: Clerk integration with OAuth providers
- **Database**: Supabase with user profiles and quotes
- **Alabama Quoting**: Real CMS.gov API integration

## 🎯 **AFTERNOON PRIORITIES:**

### **1. ISSUE #2: AUTHENTICATION FLOW (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Current State**: Working but multiple redirect steps
**Goal**: Streamlined single-step authentication

**Current Flow:**
```
Homepage → Clerk Redirect → White Page → Multiple Steps → Dashboard
```

**Desired Flow:**
```
Homepage → Modal/Inline Auth → Dashboard (single step)
```

**Technical Approach:**
- Switch from `mode="redirect"` to `mode="modal"` in SignInButton
- Add custom styling to match brand
- Test authentication flow end-to-end

### **2. DESIGN ENHANCEMENT (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Focus Areas:**
- Homepage visual polish (shadows, spacing, animations)
- Dashboard card styling improvements
- Consistent color palette and typography
- Professional insurance industry aesthetic

### **3. ISSUE #3 & #4: URL AND CONFIGURATION (LOW PRIORITY)**
- Verify production domain configuration
- Clean up any remaining redirect issues
- Environment variable optimization
