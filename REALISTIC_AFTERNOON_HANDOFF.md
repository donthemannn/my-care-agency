## 🎯 **YOUR AFTERNOON PRIORITIES**

### **🎨 PRIMARY: CSS & UI POLISH (Make it look like $1M app)**
1. **Fix dashboard cards** - Should be styled shadcn/ui cards, not plain text
2. **Professional appearance** - This needs to look premium
3. **Responsive design** - Mobile and desktop optimization
4. **Check for blue header** - Should see "VERCEL DEPLOYMENT v8.0" on dashboard

### **🔐 SECONDARY: Login Flow Polish**
1. **Smooth post-authentication** - Currently works but could be smoother
2. **Remove any extra redirect steps** - Streamline user experience
3. **Dashboard loading optimization**

### **❌ OUT OF SCOPE (Evening Team):**
- **ACA Quoting functionality** - Don't touch this, it's for evening
- **Major feature additions** - Focus on polish only
- **Database changes** - Keep existing structure
