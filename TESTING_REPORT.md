## 🎯 NEXT STEPS:

### **URGENT - Deployment Issue Resolution:**
1. **Check Vercel Dashboard:** Look for build errors or deployment failures
2. **Verify Branch Settings:** Ensure production is deploying from `master` branch
3. **Check Build Logs:** Look for any errors during the build process
4. **Manual Deployment:** Try triggering a manual deployment in Vercel
5. **Environment Variables:** Verify all required env vars are set in Vercel

### **Possible Causes:**
1. **Build Failure:** TypeScript errors or missing dependencies
2. **Route Configuration:** Issue with Next.js app router setup
3. **Environment Variables:** Missing required variables for Clerk/Supabase
4. **Vercel Settings:** Incorrect build or deployment configuration
5. **Branch Mismatch:** Production not deploying from correct branch

### **Quick Fixes to Try:**
1. **Redeploy in Vercel:** Go to Vercel dashboard → Deployments → Redeploy
2. **Check Environment Variables:** Ensure NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY is set
3. **Verify Build Command:** Should be `next build`
4. **Check Output Directory:** Should be `.next`
