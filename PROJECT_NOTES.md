# PROJECT NOTES

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES

### NO MOCK DATA POLICY
**NEVER USE MOCK DATA IN THIS PROJECT**
- Mock data messes everything up
- Always use real data from actual APIs and services
- If data isn't available, fix the data source - don't mock it
- This applies to all features: ACA estimator, quotes, plans, everything

### QUALITY STANDARDS
- This will be the most perfect app ever created for the insurance industry
- Take time to debug properly rather than shortcuts
- Real functionality with real data only
- Build it right the first time

### DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY
- Deploy with one feature working perfectly (ACA estimator)
- All other features show "Coming Soon" until fully implemented
- No half-working features - either fully functional or clearly marked as coming soon
