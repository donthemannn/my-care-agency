## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS FOR MORNING AGENT:**

### **Priority 1: Fix Dashboard Styling (30 minutes)**

**The Issue:**
- Dashboard code is perfect with shadcn/ui cards
- But rendering as plain text instead of styled cards
- Blue header shows deployment is working

**Debugging Steps:**
1. **Check Browser Console:** Look for CSS/JS errors
2. **Verify Tailwind:** Ensure globals.css is loading
3. **Test Component Imports:** Verify shadcn/ui components are importing correctly
4. **Check Build Output:** Look for any component compilation issues

**Likely Solutions:**
```bash
# Option 1: Rebuild and redeploy
cd /Users/randydonaldson/my-care-agency
npm run build
# Check for any build warnings about components

# Option 2: Check if Tailwind classes are being purged
# Look at the generated CSS in browser dev tools

# Option 3: Force component re-render
# Add a small change to dashboard/page.tsx and redeploy
```

### **Priority 2: Test Alabama Quoting (15 minutes)**
1. Navigate to `/quoting/quotes/alabama`
2. Fill form with Alabama zip code (35201, 35203, 35204)
3. Generate quotes and verify real insurance plans appear
4. Check quote history saves to database

### **Priority 3: Comprehensive Testing (30 minutes)**
1. **Authentication Flow:** Sign out/in, test all providers
2. **All Pages:** Dashboard, Alabama quoting, settings
3. **API Endpoints:** Test quote generation, profile sync
4. **Mobile Responsive:** Test on different screen sizes
